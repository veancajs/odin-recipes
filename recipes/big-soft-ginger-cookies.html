    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar: You'll need about a cup of sugar for the cookie dough, plus about two tablespoons of sugar for
            rolling the dough balls.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookies structure and helps create a tender texture.</li>
        <li>Spices: These soft gingerbread cookies are spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it makes the dough rise.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Butter: Butter is great for making perfectly soft ginger cookies with slightly crisp edges. If you'd like,
            you can substitute margarine.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and acts as a binding agent (it holds the dough together).</li>
        <li>Molasses: Molasses lends warm, cozy, and sweet flavor to these soft gingerbread cookies.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
