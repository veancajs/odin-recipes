    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>German pancakes are a childhood favorite of mine. Golden pan-style egg dish, with lots of big bubbles while
        baking. We eat these every Sunday morning. Serve with maple syrup.
    </p>
    <p>This German pancake recipe is light, fluffy, and easy to make with ingredients you likely already have on hand.
